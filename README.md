Technical Assessments
---

Hello!

This repository contains a project which will be used as the basis for your technical assessment when applying to join a BBC team.

The project makes up part of a mock election system which could show results similar to how BBC News covers elections, for example: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c37d28xdn99t/scottish-parliament-election-2021.

Before the assessment interview itself you don't need to do any work on the application, however we would like you to familiarise yourself with your chosen assessment, and follow its "setup" step. In the assessment we will ask you to screenshare your working environment with us (we use Zoom) as we discuss and work on the following:

1) How does the software work?
2) Are there any changes/improvements that you would suggest and/or want to tackle?
3) Our elections product team have asked for some new features to be added! With the help of a pair, you will be asked to try to implement one or more of these features.
